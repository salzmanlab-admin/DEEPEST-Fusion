# Rabix installation

More information on how to install Rabix can be found in the http://rabix.io/. 

However, the official rabix doesn't work on cluster without docker, so if one wants to run DEEPEST-Fusion on local cluster without docker our own version of rabix should be downloaded. In addition, please set environment variables RABIX.CORES, RABIX.MEMORY which are used by rabix to determine available resources on the local machine/cluster
